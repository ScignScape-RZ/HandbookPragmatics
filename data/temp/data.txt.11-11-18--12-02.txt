Triggs is a lexicographer. Over his desk hangs the 18th-century dictionary maker Samuel Johnson's ironical definition: "A writer of dictionaries; a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original, and detailing the signification of words."

Facts about the world thus come in twice on the road from meaning to truth: once to determine the interpretation, given the meaning, and then again to determine the truth value, given the interpretation. This insight we owe to David Kaplan's important work on indexicals and demon- stratives, and we believe it is absolutely crucial to semantics.
